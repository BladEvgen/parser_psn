Here will be versions of the playstation store site parser, this script receives the "Name" and "Price" of the game and sends them to telegrams through the bot, to change the list of games for which prices will be monitored, use url.txt. Add links to it in the following format:
https://playstation.com/example/1,
https://playstation.com/example/2,
https://playstation.com/example/n
