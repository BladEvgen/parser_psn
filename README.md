  <h1>PlayStation Store Site Parser</h1>
  <p>Here will be versions of the PlayStation Store site parser. This script receives the <code>Title</code> and <code>Price</code> of the game and sends them to Telegram through the bot. To change the list of games for which prices will be monitored, use <code>url.txt</code>. Add links to it in the following format:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>https://playstation.com/example/1,</li>
    <li>https://playstation.com/example/2,</li>
    <li>https://playstation.com/example/n</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Versions that are considered more working (in my understanding) will be located in the <code>works</code> folder. The rest, in the <code>progress</code> folder, there will be versions with different ideas and testing versions.</p>

  <p><code>.env</code> file must be located before the <code>parse</code> folder.</p>
