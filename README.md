  <h1>Playstation Store Site Parser</h1>
  <p>Here will be versions of the Playstation Store site parser. This script receives the "Title" and "Price" of the game and sends them to Telegram through the bot.</p>
  <p>To change the list of games for which prices will be monitored, use <code>url.txt</code>. Add links to it in the following format:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>https://playstation.com/example/1</li>
    <li>https://playstation.com/example/2</li>
    <li>https://playstation.com/example/n</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Versions that I consider more working (in my understanding) will be located in the <strong>works</strong> folder, while the rest will be in the <strong>progress</strong> folder.</p>
  <p><code>.env</code> must be located before the <code>parse</code> folder.</p>
